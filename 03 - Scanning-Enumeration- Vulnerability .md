# Scanning - Enumeration - Vulnerability

**Scanning** - discovering systems on the network and looking at what ports are open as well as applications that may be running

**Connectionless Communication** - UDP packets are sent without creating a connection.  Examples are TFTP, DNS (lookups only) and DHCP

**Connection-Oriented Communication** - TCP packets require a connection due to the size of the data being transmitted and to ensure deliverability

### <u>TCP Flags</u>

| Flag | Name           | Function                                                     |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SYN  | Synchronize    | Set during initial communication.  Negotiating of parameters and sequence numbers |
| ACK  | Acknowledgment | Set as an acknowledgement to the SYN flag.  Always set after initial SYN |
| RST  | Reset          | Forces the termination of a connection (in both directions)  |
| FIN  | Finish         | Ordered close to communications                              |
| PSH  | Push           | Forces the delivery of data without concern for buffering    |
| URG  | Urgent         | Data inside is being sent out of band.  Example is cancelling a message |

### <u>TCP Handshake</u>

- SYN -> SYN-ACK - ACK
- Sequence numbers increase on new communication.  Example is computers A and B.  A would increment B's sequence number.  A would never increment it's own sequence.

### <u>Port Numbers</u>

- **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority** (IANA) - maintains Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry which lists all port number reservations

- Ranges

  - **Well-known ports** - 0 - 1023

  - **Registered ports** - 1024 - 49,151

  - **Dynamic ports** - 49,152 - 65,535

    | Port Number | Protocol | Transport Protocol |
    | ----------- | -------- | ------------------ |
    | 20/21       | FTP      | TCP                |
    | 22          | SSH      | TCP                |
    | 23          | Telnet   | TCP                |
    | 25          | SMTP     | TCP                |
    | 53          | DNS      | TCP/UDP            |
    | 67          | DHCP     | UDP                |
    | 69          | TFTP     | UDP                |
    | 80          | HTTP     | TCP                |
    | 110         | POP3     | TCP                |
    | 135         | RPC      | TCP                |
    | 137-139     | NetBIOS  | TCP/UDP            |
    | 143         | IMAP     | TCP                |
    | 161/162     | SNMP     | UDP                |
    | 389         | LDAP     | TCP/UDP            |
    | 443         | HTTPS    | TCP                |
    | 445         | SMB      | TCP                |
    | 514         | SYSLOG   | UDP                |

  - A service is said to be **listening** for a port when it has that specific port open

  - Once a service has made a connection, the port is in an **established** state

  - Netstat

    - Shows open ports on computer
    - **netstat -an** displays connections in numerical form
    - **netstat -b** displays executables tied to the open port (admin only)

### <u>Subnetting</u>

- **IPv4 Main Address Types**
  - **Unicast** - acted on by a single recipient
  - **Multicast** - acted on by members of a specific group
  - **Broadcast** - acted on by everyone on the network
    - **Limited** - delivered to every system in the domain (255.255.255.255)
    - **Directed** - delivered to all devices on a subnet and use that broadcast address
- **Subnet mask** - determines how many address available on a specific subnet
  - Represented by three methods
    - **Decimal** - 255.240.0.0
    - **Binary** - 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000
    - **CIDR** - x.x.x.x/12   (where x.x.x.x is an ip address on that range)
  - If all the bits in the host field are 1s, the address is the broadcast
  - If they are all 0s, it's the network address
  - Any other combination indicates an address in the range

### <u>Scanning Methodology</u>

- **Check for live systems** - ping or other type of way to determine live hosts
- **Check for open ports** - once you know live host IPs, scan them for listening ports
- **Scan beyond IDS** - if needed, use methods to scan  beyond the detection systems
- **Perform banner grabbing** - grab from servers as well as perform OS fingerprinting
- **Scan for vulnerabilities** - use tools to look at the vulnerabilities of open systems
- **Draw network diagrams** - shows logical and physical pathways into networks
- **Prepare proxies** - obscures efforts to keep you hidden

### <u>Identifying Targets</u>

- The easiest way to scan for live systems is through ICMP.

- It has it's shortcomings and is sometimes blocked on hosts that are actually live.

- **Message Types and Returns**

  | ICMP Message Type           | Description and Codes                                        |
  | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | 0:  Echo Reply              | Answer to a Type 8 Echo Request                              |
  | 3:  Destination Unreachable | Error message followed by these codes:<br />0 - Destination network unreachable<br />1 - Destination host unreachable<br />6 - Network unknown<br />7 - Host unknown<br />9 - Network administratively prohibited<br />10 - Host administratively prohibited<br />13 - Communication administratively prohibited |
  | 4: Source Quench            | A congestion control message                                 |
  | 5: Redirect                 | Sent when there are two or more gateways available for the sender to use.  Followed by these codes:<br />0 - Redirect datagram for the network<br />1 - Redirect datagram for the host |
  | 8:  Echo Request            | A ping message, requesting an echo reply                     |
  | 11:  Time Exceeded          | Packet took too long to be routed (code 0 is TTL expired)    |

  - Payload of an ICMP message can be anything; RFC never set what it was supposed to be.  Allows for covert channels
  - **Ping sweep** - easiest method to identify hosts
  - **ICMP Echo scanning** - sending an ICMP Echo Request to the network IP address
  - An ICMP return of type 3 with a code of 13 indicates a poorly configured firewall
  - **Ping scanning tools**
    - Nmap
    - Angry IP Scanner
    - Solar-Winds Engineer Toolkit
    - Advanced IP Scanner
    - Pinkie
  - Nmap virtually always does a ping sweep with scans unless you turn it off

### <u>Port Scan Types</u>

- **Full connect** - TCP connect or full open scan - full connection and then tears down with RST
  - Easiest to detect, but most reliable
  - nmap -sT
- **Stealth** - half-open scan or SYN scan - only SYN packets sent.  Responses same as full.
  - Useful for hiding efforts and evading firewalls
  - nmap -sS
- **Inverse TCP flag** - uses FIN, URG or PSH flag.  Open/Filtered gives no response.  Closed gives RST/ACK
  - nmap -sF (FIN scan)
  
- **Null SCAN** - No flags at all,  works if an operating system’s TCP/IP implementation is based on RFC 793
  - - nmap -sN (Null scan) Open/Filtered gives no response.  Closed gives RST/ACK
  
- **Xmas** - so named because all flags are turned on so it's "lit up" like a Christmas tree
  - Responses are same as Inverse TCP scan
  - Do not work against Windows machines
  - nmap -sX
- **ACK flag probe** - multiple methods
  - TTL version - if TTL of RST packet < 64, port is open
  - Window version - if the Window on the RST packet is anything other than 0, port open
  - Can be used to check filtering.  If ACK is sent and no response, stateful firewall present.
  - nmap -sA (ACK scan)
  - nmap -sW (Window scan)
- **IDLE Scan** - uses a third party to check if a port is open
  - Looks at the IPID to see if there is a repsonse
  - Only works if third party isn't transmitting data
  - Sends a request to the third party to check IPID id; then sends a spoofed packet to the target with a return of the third party; sends a request to the third party again to check if IPID increased.
    - IPID increase of 1 indicates port closed
    - IPID increase of 2 indicates port open
    - IPID increase of anything greater indicates the third party was not idle
  - nmap -sI <zombie host>
  
- **UDP Scan** - Returns ICMP unreachable(3) if port closed , Nothing returned if port Open/Filtered(FW)

### <u>Ping</u>
- for /L %V in (1 1 254) do PING -n 1 192.168.2.%V | FIND /I “Reply” - lets a tester enumerate live systems in a class C network via ICMP using native Windows tools


### <u>Evasion</u>

- To evade IDS, sometimes you need to change the Method or the SPEED you scan
- **Tunnelling** - Is a way to tunnel scan traffic inside SSH for example.
- One method is to fragment packets (nmap -f switch)
- **OS Fingerprinting**
  - **Active**  - sending crafted packets to the target
  - **Passive** - sniffing network traffic for things such as TTL windows, DF flags and ToS fields
- **Spoofing** - can only be used when you don't expect a response back to your machine
- **Source routing** - specifies the path a packet should take on the network; most systems don't allow this anymore
- **IP Address Decoy** - sends packets from your IP as well as multiple other decoys to confuse the IDS/Firewall as to where the attack is really coming from
  - nmap -D RND:10 x.x.x.x
  - nmap -D decoyIP1,decoyIP2....,sourceIP,.... [target]
- **Proxy** - hides true identity by filtering through another computer.  Also can be used for other purposes such as content blocking evasion, etc.
  - **Proxy chains** - chaining multiple proxies together
    - Proxy Switcher
    - Proxy Workbench
    - ProxyChains
- **Tor** - a specific type of proxy that uses multiple hops to a destination; endpoints are peer computers
- **Anonymizers** - hides identity on HTTP traffic (port 80)

### <u>Enumeration</u>

- Defined as listing the items that are found within a specific target
- Always is active in nature

### <u>Windows System Basics</u>

- Everything runs within context of an account
- **Security Context** - user identity and authentication information
- **Security Identifier** (SID) - identifies a user, group or computer account
- **Resource Identifier** (RID) - portion of the SID identifying a specific user, group or computer
- The end  of the SID indicates the user number
  - Example SID:  S-1-5-21-3874928736-367528774-1298337465-**500**
  - **Administrator Account** - SID of 500
  - **Regular Accounts** - start with a SID of 1000
  - **Linux Systems** used user IDs (UID) and group IDs (GID).  Found in /etc/passwd .
  - The "/etc/shadow" file stores actual password in encrypted format and other passwords related information such as user name, last password change date, password expiration values, etc,. It's a text file and readable only by the root user and is therefore less of a security risk
  
- **SAM Database** - file where all local passwords are stored (encrypted)
  - Stored in C:\Windows\System32\Config
 
- **Linux Enumeration Commands**
  - **finger** - info on user and host machine
  - **rpcinfo and rpcclient** - info on RPC in the environment
  - **showmount** - displays all shared directories on the machine

### <u>Banner Grabbing</u>

- **Active** - sending specially crafted packets and comparing responses to determine OS
- **Passive** - reading error messages, sniffing traffic or looking at page extensions
- Easy way to banner grab is connect via telnet on port (e.g. 80 for web server)
- **Netcat** can also be used to banner grab
  - nc <IPaddress or FQDN> <port number>
- Can be used to get information about OS or specific server info (such as web server, mail server, etc.)

### <u>NetBIOS Enumeration</u>

- NetBIOS provides name servicing, connectionless communication and some Session layer stuff
- The browser service in Windows designed to host information about all machines within domain or TCP/IP network segment
- NetBIOS name is a **16-character ASCII string** used to identify devices
- Command on Windows is **nbtstat**
  - nbtstat (gives your own info)
  - nbtstat -n (gives local table)
  - nbtstat -A IPADDRESS (gives remote information)
  - nbtstat -c (gives cache information)

| Code | Type   | Meaning                   |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| <1B> | UNIQUE | Domain master browser     |
| <1C> | UNIQUE | Domain controller         |
| <1D> | GROUP  | Master browser for subnet |
| <00> | UNIQUE | Hostname                  |
| <00> | GROUP  | Domain name               |
| <03> | UNIQUE | Service running on system |
| <20> | UNIQUE | Server service running    |

- NetBIOS name resolution doesn't work on IPv6
- **Other Tools**
  - SuperScan
  - Hyena
  - NetScanTools Pro
  - NetBIOS Enumerator
  - NSAuditor

### <u>SNMP Enumeration</u>

- **Management Information Base** (MIB) - database that stores information
- **Object Identifiers** (OID) - identifiers for information stored in MIB
- **SNMP GET** - gets information about the system
- **SNMP SET** - sets information about the system
- **Types of objects**
  - **Scalar** - single object
  - **Tabular** - multiple related objects that can be grouped together
- SNMP uses community strings which function as passwords
- There is a read-only and a read-write version
- Default read-only string is **public** and default read-write is **private**
- These are sent in cleartext unless using SNMP v3
- **Tools**
  - OpUtils
  - SNScan
  - SNMPScanner
  - Engineer's Toolset

### <u>Other Enumerations</u>

- **LDAP**
  - Connects on 389 to a Directory System Agent (DSA)
  - Returns information such as valid user names, domain information, addresses, telephone numbers, system data, organization structure and other items
  - **Tools**
    - Softerra
    - JXplorer
    - Lex
    - LDAP Admin Tool
- **NTP**
  - Runs on UDP 123

  - RCPT TO - defines recipients


### <u>Vulnerability Scanning</u>

- Corressponds to PCI DSS requirement 11 : Regular testing of security systems and processes involves running internal and external vulnerability scans for all organizations involved in payment card processing.
- Can be complex or simple tools run against a target to determine vulnerabilities
- Common Vulnerability scanning system(CVSS): Open framework, managed by national vulnerability database(NVD)
  - Base Metrics: Inherent charchteristics of vulnerability
  - Temporal Metrics: features that keep changing by time during vulnerability lifetime
  - Environmental Metrics: features based on specific environment or implementation
  - 0-10 : 10 Most severe
  - None,low, medium, high, critical
- Common Vulnerability Exposure(CVE): MITRE open database, uses CVE IDs
- National vulnerability database(NVD) : NIST Open DB , contains analysis on CVE/CVSS
- Creating baseline → vulnerability assessment →risk assessment → remediation →verification →monitor.


- Host-based Assessment - Host-based assessments are a type of security check that involve carrying out a configuration-level check through the command line. These assessments check the security of a particular network,server,system. Identify vulnerabilities such as incorrect registry and file permissions, as well as software configuration errors. Host-based assessments can use many commercial and open-source scanning tools.

External Assessment - from a hacker’s point of view to find out what exploits and vulnerabilities are accessible to the outside world. 

Network based Assessments - determine the possible network security attacks that may occur on an organization’s system. These assessments evaluate the organization’s system for vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, and weak encryption.

Internal Assessment - An internal assessment involves scrutinizing the internal network to find exploits and vulnerabilities.

Application Assessments - focuses on transactional Web applications, traditional client server applications, and hybrid systems. It analyzes all elements of an application infrastructure, including deployment and communication within the client and server. This type of assessment tests the web server infrastructure for any misconfiguration, outdated content, and known vulnerabilities. Security professionals use both commercial and open-source tools to perform such assessments.

Passive Assessment - sniff the traffic present on the network to identify vulnerabilities

Active Assessment - uses network scanners to scan the network to identify vulnerabilities
